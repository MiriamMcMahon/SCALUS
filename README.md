# SCALUS - Session Client Application Launch Uri System

This is a proxy/dispatcher for URI protocol handlers. A URL protocol is the part of the url before the : for example http or https are URL protocols.  Specifically, SCALUS is intended to handle protocols like ssh or rdp but it can be used for any protocol. SCALUS lets you register a URL protocol with the underlying operating system and allows you to configure other programs to launch to handle that URL. 
The configuration allows you to define variables that pull their values from parts of the URL and those can be passed on the command line or via a configuration file to tools like ssh, rdesktop, RdpClient, FreeRDP etc.
